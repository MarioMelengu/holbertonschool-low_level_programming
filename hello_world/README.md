# C Project README

This project consists of several tasks that illustrate various stages of the C compilation process and basic programming concepts. Below is a concise description of each task along with the corresponding file names.

## Tasks Overview

### 0-preprocessor
**Filename:** `0-preprocessor`  
**Description:** This script runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the output to another file. It processes directives such as `#include` and `#define`, preparing the code for compilation.

### 1-compiler
**Filename:** `1-compiler`  
**Description:** This script compiles a C file without linking. It generates an object file, enabling separate compilation for modular development.

### 2-assembler
**Filename:** `2-assembler`  
**Description:** This script generates the assembly code from a C source file and saves it to an output file. It represents a step between high-level C code and machine code.

### 3-name
**Filename:** `3-name`  
**Description:** This script compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`. It simplifies the process of building and executing the program.

### 4-puts.c
**Filename:** `4-puts.c`  
**Description:** This C program prints the message: "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle," followed by a new line. It demonstrates basic string output in C.

### 5-printf.c
**Filename:** `5-printf.c`  
**Description:** This C program prints the message: "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art," followed by a new line. It showcases the use of formatted output.

### 6-size.c
**Filename:** `6-size.c`  
**Description:** This C program prints the size of various data types on the computer it is compiled and run on. It helps in understanding data types and memory allocation.
