# C Project: Command-Line Arguments and Basic Operations

This project contains several C programs, each designed to demonstrate fundamental concepts such as command-line arguments and basic arithmetic operations.

## Task List

### 1. **[0-whatsmyname.c](0-whatsmyname.c)**
   - **Description**: This program prints its own name followed by a newline.
   - **Objective**: Understand how to access and print the program's name.
   - **Usage**: No command-line arguments are required.

### 2. **[1-args.c](1-args.c)**
   - **Description**: This program prints the number of arguments passed into it.
   - **Objective**: Learn how to count the number of command-line arguments.
   - **Usage**: Run the program with any number of arguments to see the count.

### 3. **[2-args.c](2-args.c)**
   - **Description**: This program prints all arguments passed to it.
   - **Objective**: Demonstrate how to iterate over and print each command-line argument.
   - **Usage**: Pass multiple arguments when running the program to see them printed.

### 4. **[3-mul.c](3-mul.c)**
   - **Description**: This program multiplies two numbers provided as command-line arguments.
   - **Objective**: Learn how to handle and perform operations on numbers passed via command-line arguments.
   - **Usage**: Execute with two integer arguments, and it will print the product.

### 5. **[4-add.c](4-add.c)**
   - **Description**: This program adds two numbers provided as command-line arguments.
   - **Objective**: Practice using command-line arguments to perform arithmetic addition.
   - **Usage**: Run the program with two integer arguments, and it will print the sum.
